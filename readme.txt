Most Popular Tags is a plugin that displays your blog's most popular tags or categories as a sidebar widget

== Description ==

Most Popular Tags is a WordPress plugin that allows you to display your blog's most popular tags or categories as a sidebar widget. The plugin takes advantage of the new Widget API introduced in WordPress 2.8, allowing multiple instances of the same widget, each with it's own unique configuration. You can specify how many tags to show, the size of the smallest and largest tags, which unit and format to use as well as advanced ordering options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `mostpopulartags.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The Most Popular Tags widget can now be configured and used from the Appearance -> Widgets menu

== Changelog ==

- 2.5: Added a nifty uninstaller that removes all traces of the plugin when it's deleted via the Manage Plugins menu
- 2.0.1: Readme.txt spelling corrections
- 2.0: Added the option to display categories in addition to tags
- 1.1: Added millimeters, centimeters, inches and picas to the font unit menu. Additionally, all of the settings have been updated with more descriptive text.

== Miscellaneous ==

Version 0.6 of this plugin, which adds advanced ordering options, was heavily contributed to by Alexandre Piccolo - http://www.piparote.com
